Activity Flow
_____________________________________________________________

1.	Body factory creates body part and deposit into body bin
2.	Body and paint server takes 1 unit from body bin and holds self for time.
3.	Body and paint server produces and deposit 1 unit into assembled body bin
4.	Transmission factory creates transmission and deposit into transmission bin
5.	Engine factory creates engine and deposit into engine bin 
6.	T&E Server takes 1 unit from each, assembled body bin, transmission bin, and engine bin 
7.	T&E Server holds self and deposit 1 unit into assembled car bin
8.	Testing Server takes 1 unit from assembled car bin and hold self
9.	Testing Server deposit 1 unit into Tested bin
10.	Shipping Server takes 5 units from Tested bin and hold self


General Form of factories (body, engine, transmission)
_________________________________________________________

While simclock < Simulation Time
Hold self for time (set up random generator by stats in pdf)
Give 1 unit to appropriated bin (Assembly.bodyParts)
Display time when unit is given, must be in trace and can also display while program running
Accumulate parts created for each type


General Form of Stations (B&P, T&E, Test)
__________________________________________

While simclock < Simulation Time
Take one unit from appropriated bin
Display time when unit is taken	
If unit are not available accumulate wait time 
Hold self for time
Give 1 unit to the next bin 
Display time unit is given to bin
Accumulate parts created for each type


General Form of Shipping station
__________________________________

While simclock< Simulation Time
Take 5 units from Assembly.testedCar
Display when 5 units are taken (ex. message: Truck loaded at simclock)
If 5 units are not available accumulate wait time 
Hold self for time
Display message for completed shipping
Accumulate number of shipped cars
